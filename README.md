Candy themed role-playing game

In progress - currently text-based

Characters moves through different areas, fighting candy monsters and receiving gold, armor, and weapons as a reward for defeating them. A character has various normal fighting stats: damage, health, defense, critical strike chance. These stats are improved by armor and weapons. The best items are candy themed "legendary" items that are organized into sets. If you have all the members of an equipment, you get special bonuses.
